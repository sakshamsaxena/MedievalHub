<h3>About Me</h3>
<blockquote>" I'm going to paraphrase Thoreau here...Rather than love, than money, than fame, than fairness, give me truth." [Christopher McCandless from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758758/" target="_blank">Into The Wild</a>]<br></blockquote>

<p>Funny how few simple words can say so much, but then, truth is always expressed as such.</p>
<p><span itemprop="description">My name is <span itemprop="name">Saksham Saxena</span> and I created this Medieval Hub. This is simply a blog written by me where I write about all those things which make this life worth living, which gives a sense of reason in this world of utter madness with people running a wild-goose chase over senseless and irrelevant competitions.</span></p>
<p>As been a habit since childhood, I have always enjoyed learning, and I find even more joy in sharing my knowledge, which I will be doing here often. Being a keen <span itemprop="jobTitle">Engineering Student</span> [presently at <span itemprop="affiliation">Delhi Technological University</span>], I am always driven to think how the people can benefit from technology and pursue that line of thought.</p>
<p>Medieval Hub is always open for any relevant article submission. You can contact me through <a href="mailto:saksham_saxena@outlook.com?Subject=Feedback">Email</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/saksham.saxena.334">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://plus.google.com/107908505866237517547" rel="author">Google Plus</a> for the same. Thank you for visiting.</p>

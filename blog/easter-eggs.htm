<p><span class="first">T</span>he new age Web Designers are like <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Lotus+Flower">Thom Yorke</a>. They have ideas, creativity, and a level of cool which demands respect. Those who see it, well, they begin to love it, and maybe think of this as a new revolution, whereas those who don't, they remain cynical about it until they have completely drowned themselves into denial, which is just plain stupid.</p>
<p>Easter eggs are not just eggs. In fact, they aren't real/plastic eggs at all. They are secret and special features of any material (of digital world) like websites, <a href="http://eeggs.com/top25/1119">software</a> or games. For a web designer, hired or amateur, the Easter eggs are a way to express their true self as well as show off their skills in a way which would only be conspicuous to folks who would try to look for them. If they are critics or simply some curious minds, these would be the things which will scoop them in your awe, and that's something which you can definitely expect, because pulling off the eggs' trick is tricky. If you pull it off, you become the Batman (just saying), as method like these can be used to distinguish and quantify the skills and creativeness of a web designer since the websites which they create are received subjectively everywhere and so you cannot put it on a scale to measure.</p>
<p>Just like video games have cheat codes and hidden levels and movies have <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_20622_5-mind-blowing-movie-easter-eggs-that-give-away-ending.html">subliminal messages</a>, software and websites have Easter eggs to give the users some nice surprises which would definitely make them love the thing and its developers. It's the geek's way of earning respect in the community. If you plan to stick around in this digital world, you might as well give this a thought. Good luck on your hunt :)</p>

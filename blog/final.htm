<p><span class="first">Y</span>es that's right. It's shutting down. It's time for this beauty to indulge in an endless slumber. Yes, it seemed like a journey which had just begun, but the purpose it carried is complete. This is the last post on Medieval Hub.</p>
<p>MH has been a constant source of inspiration. When I first started out in Web Designing, creating and designing my own blog was the goal I kept in my mind. It was supposed to be my very own blog. It was supposed to have the looks and the feel which would reflect a part of me, the child in me, the geek in me, who used to play AOE all day, and how those Aztecs and Huns became a part of my life, how those stories of Jaguar warrior and Attila the Hun fascinated me beyond words. All this and more, every day and ever week. Medieval Hub always reminded me of me. It was my escape.</p>
<p>Over the time, I received some valuable feedback and encouragement which motivated me to write more and more articles on designing which are not talked about so often in the community. Probably that's why I took my time while writing the <a href="jquery-plugin-needs.htm">previous post</a> on jQuery plugins' usage. It ended up being painfully long and subjective, maybe even slightly undecisive, on the subject. Alas, it wasn't the best article I wrote, but I believe it was the only one in which I stated my thoughts with complete honesty.</p>
<p>The most beautiful thing about MH is that I designed it from scratch, all by myself. All its components and widgets were designed by me. It was a long and tedious process, getting everything right so that it looks neat and medieval. I learnt a lot this way about web designing from a technical point of view as well as from an artist's point of view as well. The latter perspective inspired the creation of <a href="http://dtu.sakshamsaxena.in">MARKS</a>. It was designed within 3 days and took further 3-4 days of testing and file management. Probably I'll be focusing on its maintenance with greater detail and might implement changes whenever the need arises. </p>
<p>It's a bit hard to pin-point the exact reason for shutting this down. Medieval Hub was basically a "project" which started me on this journey. It was a motivation all along, as it kept my presence on the Internet for real, in the real world. This blog was an epitome of my skills and it got me a lot of recogonition in my university. Thus I started exploring more and more into web designing and I realised that what I actually want to focus on is web animations and related interactive web applications. Being a veteran Front End developer is not exactly my plan. Medieval Hub made me realise all this, and since I have realised it, it's time to let it go. It is impractical for me to keep this blog up and running given the constraints I have. </p>
<p>So, it's time to go. Thank you for being a part of Medieval Hub. Farewell.</p>

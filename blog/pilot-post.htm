<p><span class="first">M</span>edieval Hub is simply a place where I’ll be sharing a lot of cool and exciting things like tutorials on Web Designing, MATLAB and much more along with a walkthrough of my projects.</p>
<p>Since majority of the posts will be related to coding, I must stress on some major ideas related to it. One should, at least by now, understand that coding today has gone to a different level, in a sense that is being made easier and easier to access and implement on a large number of platforms so that maximum number of people have utmost convenience in coding. Be it any area of IT, the code we generally write is several layers above the stage when it is “raw”, i.e., the last stage of its processing.</p>

<img id="earth" src="../content/earth.png">
<p>In Web Designing, for example, if someone writes an event handler function in jQuery for an event like a mouse click on a link, the browser records that event and looks it up in the DOM (Document Object Model) for its handler, if defined, and then reads it and parses it in the language specified there, which is broadly speaking JavaScript but methods used are of jQuery, which is thus again looked up in the jQuery library and then finally the function run is complete. So basically, you have the browser at your command and you don’t even have to mess with complicated JavaScript. You just write a method for an object and the rest is handled automatically. Similar scenarios are witnessed practically wherever there is a use of some library functions and/or APIs.</p>
<p>There are, however, a lot of people who would want everything customized according to them, and so as a result, they may find working with predefined libraries a bit claustrophobic, or some may think working solely with such libraries and APIs would not help them learn the core language in which they are written. These are very genuine notions which I have come across myself and so do a lot of people. </p>
<p>The answer is simple : each such library and API are built for the sole purpose of simplifying the writing of commonly used functions which are often lengthy and are prone to errors. The API works broadly on the same model as that of its core language, generally with the difference that the readability of the new code is enhanced, as in it is more easily read and understood as it’s now written in plain English words (generally).</p>
<p>I’ll be taking up more on coding soon in my future posts to elucidate these thoughts. Looking forward to seeing you next time!</p>
